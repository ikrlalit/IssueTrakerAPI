# 🐞 Issue Tracker API

A **production-grade Issue Tracking backend** built with **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL**, and **asyncpg**, inspired by real-world systems like **Jira** and **GitHub Issues**.

This project is designed to demonstrate **real backend engineering skills**, focusing on asynchronous performance, data integrity, and auditability.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Issue Management:** Create, update, and fetch issues with UUIDs for security.
- **Partial Updates:** Smart `PATCH` updates using Pydantic's `exclude_unset` logic.
- **Collaboration:** Assign issues to users and add threaded comments.
- **Atomic Operations:** Add and replace labels or update bulk statuses within SQL transactions.
- **Data Ingestion:** CSV import functionality for bulk issue creation.

### Reporting & Analytics
- **Top Assignees:** Identify workload distribution across the team.
- **Resolution Latency:** Calculate average time taken to resolve issues for performance metrics.

### Audit & History (The Timeline)
Each issue maintains a **complete, immutable audit trail** tracking:
- Issue creation.
- Field changes (Status, Priority, Assignee).
- Comments and label modifications.
