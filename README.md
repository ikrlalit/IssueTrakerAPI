# 🐞 Issue Tracker API

The **Issue Tracker API** is a production-grade backend system designed to manage complex software development workflows. Built with **FastAPI** and **PostgreSQL**.

This project focuses on **high-concurrency architecture** and **data integrity**. By utilizing **Raw SQL** via the **asyncpg** driver instead of a traditional ORM, the system achieves maximum performance and gives the developer full control over database execution plans.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Issue Management:** Create, update, and fetch issues with UUIDs for security.
- **Partial Updates:** Smart `PATCH` updates using Pydantic's `exclude_unset` logic.
- **Collaboration:** Assign issues to users and add threaded comments.
- **Atomic Operations:** Add and replace labels or update bulk statuses within SQL transactions.
- **Data Ingestion:** CSV import functionality for bulk issue creation.

### Reporting & Analytics
- **Top Assignees:** Identify workload distribution across the team.
- **Resolution Latency:** Calculate average time taken to resolve issues for performance metrics.

## 🔗 Main API Endpoints

### User, Issues & Reports 
* `POST /issues` — Create a new issue
* `GET /issues` — List all issues with filters
* `GET /issues/{id}` — Get issue with comments & labels
* `PATCH /issues/{id}` — Partial update of an issue
* `POST /issues/bulk-status` — Batch update status for multiple issues
* `POST /issues/import` — Bulk creation via CSV import
* `POST /issues/{id}/comments` — Add a comment to an issue
* `PUT /issues/{id}/labels` — Atomic label replacement
* `GET /reports/top-assignees` — Fetch workload distribution
* `GET /reports/latency` — Resolution speed metrics

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

* **ID Masking:** **UUIDs** are added in each table for saftey and to prevent ID enumeration attacks.
* **SQL Injection Defense:** All database interactions use **parameterized queries** via `asyncpg`.
* **Concurrency:** Managed **connection pooling** to prevent database exhaustion under heavy load.
* **Validation:** Strict schema enforcement and data sanitization via **Pydantic**.

## 🚀 Running the Project

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the **Issue Tracker API** locally.

### 1. Database Setup
1. **Install PostgreSQL:** Download and install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and [pgAdmin4](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/).
2. **Setup DB:** Create a new database and configure your credentials (username, password, host) in `db.py`.
3. **Initialize Tables:** Execute the SQL queries provided in `dbtableschema.txt` to create the required tables and run the indexing queries for query performance improvement.
